## Project Overview

This project is a web application of a matching card game where you attempt to match 8 pets in the least amoutn of moves possible (16). The app showcases, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and our furry pets. It features game logic in order to detect matching or unmatching cards, count your moves and place your score.

## Problem Domain

As developurrs, we discovered a need to increase our neuroplasticity. To solve this, we decided to create a card matching memory game to improve our memory. We also made this game as we wanted to have a fun solution and incorporate all of our furry companions.
