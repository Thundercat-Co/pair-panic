          <h2>Pair Panic Origin Story</h2>
            <p>In the mystical realm of Code Fellows, four students embarked on an extraordinary coding journey. Thundercat, a tech-savvy feline with a penchant for lounging atop keyboards, sensed an impending chaos lurking in the codebase.

                As Ari, Genevieve, Justin, and Drew attended their Coding Class, they discovered Thundercat's peculiar powers. Together, they formed the superhero team "Pair Panic."
                
                Their mission? To battle the mischievous villain Titus, a coder with a knack for causing havoc in digital realms. With their quirky pets by their side they tackled bugs and glitches with hilarious determination.
                
                In a showdown for the ages, Titus unleashed a horde of rogue code, but Pair Panic countered with a secret weaponâ€”cat memes! Titus, unable to resist the allure, fell into a fit of laughter, allowing Pair Panic to defeat him with a stroke of coding genius.
                
                And so, Pair Panic became the guardians of Code Fellows, wielding keyboards and humor to defend against digital disasters. With their fearless antics and unwavering camaraderie, they proved that coding superheroes can save the day, one pun at a time.</p>
